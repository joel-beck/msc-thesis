# Bridging Citation Analysis and Language Models: A Hybrid Recommender System for Computer Science Papers

This repository presents my master's thesis, "Bridging Citation Analysis and Language Models: A Hybrid Recommender System for Computer Science Papers", submitted to the University of GÃ¶ttingen on September 26th, 2023, as a requirement for the Master of Science in Applied Statistics.

The thesis was supervised by supervised by [Dr. Corinna Breitinger](https://gipplab.org/team/corinna-breitinger/) and [Dr. Terry Ruas](https://gipplab.org/team/dr-terry-lima-ruas/) from the [Chair for Scientific Information Analytics](https://gipplab.org) at the University of GÃ¶ttingen.

As part of this thesis, I developed the [readnext](https://github.com/joel-beck/readnext) package that implements the hybrid recommender system in a Python package.
See the [readnext documentation](https://joel-beck.github.io/readnext/) for more information about the installation and usage of the package.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

This repository contains the following folders:

- **PDF Versions**: The final versions of the thesis are located in the `thesis/` folder. For reading the thesis as a PDF document, see [`beck-joel_masters-thesis.pdf`](thesis/beck-joel_masters-thesis.pdf). For printing the thesis, see [`beck-joel_masters-thesis_print.pdf`](thesis/beck-joel_masters-thesis_print.pdf).

- **LaTeX Source Code**: The `main.tex` file in the root directory builds the thesis. The individual chapters are located in the `chapters/` folder. The `macros/` folder contains custom LaTeX commands.

- **Python Source Code**: The source code to generate the data-based figures in the thesis is located in the `code/` folder. The underlying data is not included in this repository, but can be generated by running the Python scripts in the `readnext/scripts/evaluation/` directory of the [readnext](https://github.com/joel-beck/readnext) repository.

- **Images**: The images used in the thesis are located in the `diagrams/`, `plots/`, `screenshots/` and `logos/` folders. The images in the `diagrams/` folder were created using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). The university logos were provided by the University of GÃ¶ttingen.
