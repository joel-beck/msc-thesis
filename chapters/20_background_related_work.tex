\chapter{Background \& Related Work} \label{sec:background-related-work}

This chapter addresses \textbf{\ac{RT} 1} as defined in \Cref{sec:research-objectives}. It presents a detailed overview of the existing literature on recommender systems for academic papers. Thereby, it introduces key concepts such as citation-based and content-based methods for recommendation, as well as hybrid recommender systems.

\Cref{sec:recommender-systems} begins with a broad overview of general recommender systems, detailing their different types and how they are evaluated. Following this, \Cref{sec:citation-analysis} explores how citation-based methods are used in recommender systems. \Cref{sec:semantic-analysis} then discusses content-based approaches, with a particular focus on language models that use the semantic information of documents. Lastly, \Cref{sec:hybrid-recommenders-for-academic-papers} summarizes the current work on hybrid recommender systems for academic papers, and highlights how this thesis contributes to the field.
