\chapter{Evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}

This chapter addresses \textbf{\ac{RT} 3} and \textbf{\ac{RT} 4} as defined in \Cref{sec:research-objectives}.
\Cref{sec:evaluation-strategy} describes the data-driven evaluation strategy used to assess the efficacy of the Hybrid Recommender. Subsequently, \Cref{sec:evaluation-results} presents and discusses the results of the evaluation.
As a first evaluation step, \Cref{sec:establishing-baseline-performance} establishes a baseline performance against which all subsequent results are compared.
Following this, \Cref{sec:evaluation-citation-recommender} explores the impact of different feature weights on the Citation Recommender's performance.
In a similar vein, \Cref{sec:evaluation-language-recommender} investigates the effect of various language models on the Language Recommender's performance.
Lastly, \Cref{sec:evaluation-hybrid-recommender} assesses whether the hybridization strategy influences the \ac{MAP} or the recommendation diversity of the Hybrid Recommender.
