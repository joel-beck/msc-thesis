\section{Research Objectives} \label{sec:research-objectives}

Driven by the increasing need for an automated, fast, and reliable academic paper recommendation system with high coverage, and recognizing the potential of both citation-based and content-based methods, we have set the following research objective:

\textbf{Design, implement, and evaluate a hybrid recommender system that - given a query paper - integrates citation-based and content-based techniques to suggest relevant and personalized academic papers to researchers.}

To achieve this objective \ac{RT} 1 - \acl{RT} 4 are derived:

\begin{description}[leftmargin=!, labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries RT 10:}]
    \item[RT 1:] Review and analyze the existing literature and methodologies related to citation-based and content-based paper recommendation systems, and identify effective ways to merge them into a hybrid system.
    \item[RT 2:] Develop and implement a performant, accessible and extensible framework that offers personalized paper recommendations using a blend of citation-based and content-based methods.
    \item[RT 3:] Identify the best-performing configuration for each individual recommender including the most effective feature weighting for the citation-based recommender and the top-performing language model for the content-based recommender.
    \item[RT 4:] Determine whether the hybrid system gives more accurate recommendations than the citation-based or content-based recommenders alone. Examine how the order of combining the methods influences the hybrid recommender's precision and diversity.
