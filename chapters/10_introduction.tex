\chapter{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

This thesis addresses the need for a paper recommender system that can reliably recommend relevant research papers customized to the user's preferences.
The paper recommender system is designed to be used by academics, who seek to stay up-to-date with the latest research in their field. The system is based on a hybrid architecture, which combines the strengths of citation-based and content-based methods.

\Cref{sec:problem-statement-motivation} introduces the problem of finding relevant research papers in an ever-growing body of scientific literature and identifies the research gap of hybrid paper recommender systems employing citation-based and content-based approaches. \Cref{sec:research-objectives} presents the research objectives and the specific research tasks this thesis aims to address. Lastly, \Cref{sec:thesis-outline} outlines the structure of the thesis.
